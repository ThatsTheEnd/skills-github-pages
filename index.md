🚀 Hello World: A Fresh Start

Welcome to my blog!

This is the kind of post every new blog starts with—the humble “Hello World.” It’s a small ritual in the programming world: spin up a new project, get it to say “Hello World,” and know that everything is wired up and working. This blog is the same. It’s my sandbox. My working notebook. My loud thinking space.

💡 Why This Blog Exists

I’ve spent a lot of time helping others (and future-me) figure out things like:
	•	How to set up a CI pipeline that doesn’t drive you insane.
	•	How to actually understand static type errors.
	•	How to talk to hardware without crying.
	•	How to make trade-offs in design decisions and not just follow trends.

Instead of keeping all those hard-earned lessons scattered across chat logs, README files, and random notes, I’m centralizing them here.

🔧 What to Expect

This won’t be polished marketing content or deep research papers. It’ll be something in between: real-world, practical, sometimes opinionated. Some topics I plan to cover:
	•	Clean Python setups with tools like Ruff, Mypy, and Poetry.
	•	CI/CD workflows that catch bugs before your coffee gets cold.
	•	Practical guides for integrating hardware into your software projects.
	•	Configuration rants: YAML vs TOML, and why it still matters.

Expect code. Expect diagrams. Expect the occasional meme if it helps make a point.

🧭 Where This Is Going

The goal isn’t just to document what I’ve done—it’s to get better at explaining it, reflecting on it, and maybe helping someone else (you?) along the way. It might be messy. It might evolve. But it starts here.

Hello, world. Let’s build something.
